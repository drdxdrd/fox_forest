                    <p>This is my first article. I write about it site and my hobby.Looks correct, other than you don't
                        need
                        the enclosing brackets in [P] in either the function definition or when you call it. You only
                        need
                        them when there are more than 1 return variables. Also, stationary_probability_initialize and P
                        must
                        have the same number of rows for you to stitch them together side by side, but your ones()
                        function
                        will handle that fine. </p>
