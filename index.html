                    <h2>General morphology</h2>
                    <div class="data_mark">Posted 20.05.2020</div>
                    <p>Foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family Canidae such as wolves and
                        jackals, while they may be larger than some within the family, such as Raccoon dogs. In the
                        largest species, the red fox, males weigh on average between 4.1 and 8.7 kilograms (9 and 19 1⁄4
                        pounds),[7] while the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just 0.7 to 1.6 kg (1 1⁄2 to 3
                        1⁄2 lb).[8]</p>
                    <p>Foxy features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated
                        rostrum, and a bushy tail. Foxes are digitigrade, and thus, walk on their toes. Unlike most
                        members of the family Canidae, foxes have partially retractable claws.[9] Fox vibrissae, or
                        whiskers, are black. The whiskers on the muzzle, mystaciae vibrissae, average 100–110
                        millimetres (3 7⁄8–4 3⁄8 inches) long, while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to
                        be shorter in length. Whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are also on the forelimbs and average 40 mm (1
                        5⁄8 in) long, pointing downward and backward.[2] Other physical characteristics vary according
                        to habitat and adaptive significance. </p>

                    <h2>Pelage</h2>
                    <div class="data_mark">Posted 12.05.2020</div>
                    <p>Fox species differ in fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to
                        black-and-white to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other
                        species of fox adapted to life in the desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears
                        and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool.[2][9] Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny
                        ears and short limbs as well as thick, insulating fur, which aid in keeping the body warm.[10]
                        Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with a white
                        marking.[11] A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are
                        richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense
                        winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the
                        legs, and then along the back.[9] Coat color may also change as the individual ages.[2] </p>

                    <p>In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live
                        up to ten years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in
                        small family groups, but some (such as Arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.[2][9]

                        Foxes are omnivores.[13][14] Their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects
                        and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many
                        species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized
                        diets. Most species of fox consume around 1 kg (2 1⁄4 lb) of food every day. Foxes cache excess
                        food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil.[9][15] While
                        hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to
                        camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force
                        and land on top of their chosen prey.[2] Using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip
                        the prey's neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.[2]

                        The gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the
                        raccoon dog.[16] </p>
