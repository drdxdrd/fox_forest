        I have a huge <span>matlab</span> program (.m file) <br> is a higher level model of some design and this
        program has bunch
        of variables. I want to store these variables in different/separate matlab file which should be .m file. So, I
        want in this way because I want to make changes with the variable values and run the original matlab program,
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>file 1</li>
        <li>file 2</li>
        <li>file 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="first">
        basically run experiments with the model with new variable values. I know we can store varibles in mat file but
        it is not writable. So, basically my question comes down to this, I can store varibales in a separate m file but
        everytime I run the original program, how can I include and load the variables (m file) in the original matlab
        program file (m file)?
    </p>
