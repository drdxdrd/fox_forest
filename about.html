                <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family
                    Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout,
                    and a long bushy tail (or brush).
                </p>
                <p> Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another
                    25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of
                    the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the
                    bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far
                    the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47
                    recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread
                    reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many
                    societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit
                    in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of
                    the New World. </p>
